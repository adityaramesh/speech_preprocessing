# Overview

An evaluation of the following preprocessing methods for speech using dynamic time warping:
- Cepstral coefficients using various filter bank coefficients.
- LPC.
- PLP.

The preprocessing schemes are evaluated based on recognition accuracy of spoken digits, using the
TIDIGITS data set.
